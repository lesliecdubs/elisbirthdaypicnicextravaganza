Camp is foundational to who I am as a human being, a statement that is true for countless thousands of people around the county. Camp provides a safe space to learn, to grow, to fail and pick yourself back up. There were many years of my life that were very dark outside of the gates of camp, and the promise of living 10 months for 2 truly was what pushed me forwards.

Both of the camps I grew up recently made the incredibly difficult decision to close for this summer, a decision that is at once both the only logical and sound decision to make and also a deeply emotionally and economically damaging one. They need our support now more than ever.
