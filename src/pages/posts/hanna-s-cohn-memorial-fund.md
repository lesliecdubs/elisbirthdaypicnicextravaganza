Money donated to my motherâ€™s memorial fund goes to fund a new Family Preparedness Project run by the Worker Justice Center of New York together with my mom's old organization, Volunteer Legal Services Project of Monroe County. 

The project responds to the growing reality for the immigrant community that American citizen children may end up in the foster care system - rather than with a trusted family member or friend - should a parent or other family member be detained or deported. 

The advocacy and education provided through the Family Preparedness Project is essential in our present climate of fear and distrust.

From my dad, Jerry Wein:

> One reason this project appealed to me is because Hanna started a very similar clinic while at VLSP. That clinic focused on clients who were HIV positive or who were living with AIDS. There were similar concerns about planning for the death or incapacity of a parent, especially in a time when the rights of gay couples were adversely defined.
>
> Hanna was a leader in pioneering the use of standby guardianships to address the needs of parents living with disabling conditions or terminal illnesses who wanted to plan a legally secure future for their children.
