Jewish Family Service of Greater Dallas is a nonsectarian mental health and social services agency that impacts over 13,000 lives a year. 

Clients seek out Jewish Family Service to help with issues ranging from addiction to family violence to suicidal ideation, loss of a job, not knowing where they are going to get their next meal and beyond. They do this work for anyone who walks through their doors, regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. 

Services are paid for on a sliding scale entirely based on what each client can afford to pay, more than 50% of the clients paying $5 or less. And they access all the services JFS provides for as long as needed.

Beyond counseling, JFS offers support groups, assessment and in-school resources for students, crisis interventions in family violence situations, career, and financial planning among many other services. They also run a robust food pantry program as well as two donation-based thrift shops.

Leslie and I have both seen the great work JFS does in the community firsthand.

Leslie sits in a leadership position on the Young Leadership Board of JFS.

Pre-COVID19, a volunteer from JFS would stop by our kitchen at the JCC three times a week to pick up and distribute kosher Meals on Wheels lunches to homebound seniors. 

Since COVID, Iâ€™ve seen the need for their services increase firsthand, and likewise seen their incredible team stretch themselves to provide support and comfort to all.
